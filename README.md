# Assessment 1
A fictional coffee shop scenario for assignment purposes. Detailed assignemnt instructions quoted below.

"Assessment 1 – Windows Apps
1. Purpose
The purpose of this assessment is to test how well you are able to integrate the concepts that you
have learned in SU1 and SU2 into a basic Windows Application.
2. Scenario
BeelteCaf is a bustling coffee shop where the smell of fresh-brewed coffee often fills the air. The
walls are adorned with colorful murals, blackboards listing the day's specials, and shelves stocked
with coffee beans and brewing equipment. Soft lighting bathes the cozy seating areas, with
comfortable armchairs and couches arranged in intimate clusters. The sound of gentle jazz music fills
the room, providing a pleasant background ambiance. Behind the counter, baristas clad in aprons
and hats work busily, expertly crafting each drink with care and precision. The aroma of fresh-baked
pastries mingles with the rich scent of coffee, tempting customers to indulge in a sweet treat. I guess
one can say that BeelteCaf feels like a warm and inviting oasis. A place where people can come
together and share a moment of relaxation and connection over a delicious cup of coffee. It is no
wonder that the shop is constantly filled with customers of all ages sipping their drinks and chatting
with friends.
The coffee shop wants to ensure they maintain high client satisfaction. It is for this reason that the
shop decided to digitalize its ordering and bookkeeping. In this regard, the shop approached you
with the following specifications:
• The application should initiate with a professional welcome screen.
• Clients should be able to easily order a variety of coffee, tea, pastries, and sandwiches. (hint,
clients do not like a bunch of pop-up screens – MDIs might help get around this).
• Clients should also be able to review their selection and remove an item from their list
before they submit their order.
• Once the clients submitted their order, they should be presented with a receipt screen – all
orders should be captured in a separate table.
• For bookkeeping purposes, BeelteCaf prefers having a separate table for all the drinks and
food. The application should allow staff to log into the system/application where they can
see accounting information such as how many of what was sold, at what time, best-selling
items, profit, etc.
• Staff members should be allowed to update the database when an item is sold out, when
there are new specials, when a new coffee is introduced, and when an item is no longer
being served.
• Staff said they would also like to have the flexibility to generate custom reports and filter the
database.
Don’t let BeetleCaf down, they believe in you.
General requirements
